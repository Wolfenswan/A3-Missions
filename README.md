<b>Mission description</b><br/>
This is based on the Shacktac quarry gamemode which was inspired by the game called 'The ship', their version is called 'The game' and was made by Kevb0.<br/><br/>
Rifling Matters (Austrialian Arma group) made a version called 'Quarry', and it is this name we use. <br/><br/><br/>
This version was made by Snippers with several ideas from the Team One Tactical Community and adapted for Folk ARPS by Wolfenswan.
