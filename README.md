<b>Introduction</b><br/>
This is one of my missions created for ArmA3 with Folk ARPS. They are based on a pre-configured version of the F3 Mission Making Framework. You are free to use and modify them for your own group if credits is still given and this readme included. If you find them useful or have any feedback please do get in touch, either per mail or via github.<br/><br/>
The missions can be found on GitHub:<br/>

Each branch is a different mission, some are WIP.<br/>

<b>Current F3 Version:</b><br/>
<i>3-2-2</i>

<b>Mission description</b><br/>
A AAF platoon is tasked to dislodge FIA from their strongholds in north-west Altis. They are split in two sections: one is inserted by helicopter to intercept any FIA reinfocements, the bigger one assaults the FIA head on with MRAP support.
