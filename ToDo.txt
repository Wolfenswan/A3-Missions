Change sides:
FIA (CTRG) defending convoy, CSAT attacking.
CTRG has to blow up, CSAT helps to EVAC (Orca + black Mohawks).

FIA: 1-2 squads, technicals at convoy
FIA: 3 squads (2*5 Men Fireteam) + technicals.
CSAT: 1 squad in 2 x Orca


Idea:
FIA is understrength (1 Squad?); NATO support is 1 squad in 2 x Ghosthawk (incl. Gunner) + maybe Pawnee--> ~32 player
CSAT is 2 motorized squads + MRAPs --> ~ 36 player

--> CSAT needs to move in and seize. NATO is tasked to land and defend. ONLY if 80% FIA die, they are allowed to blow the caches. {side _x == resistance && alive _x} count playableUnits < 2

--> caches destroyed is a "draw"/"phyrric victory"
