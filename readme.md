==
Wolfenswan [FA]: wolfenswanarps@gmail.com | folkarps.com

**INTRODUCTION**

My goal is to create a simple spawn system, aimed at two types of mission makers:

* Beginner mission makers who are not yet comfortable with SQF and prefer to mostly use the in-game editor.
* Intermediate to advanced mission makers who want to churn out small to medium sized missions on a regular basis and need a simple spawn system as foundation for their missions, allowing them to focus on building a mission around the set-pieces.

**FEATURES**

* Easy to use spawn system, with no need for SQF scripting or knowing class names.
* Currently supports spawning of the following groups: Hold, Patrol, Garrison, Ambush, Ambush-road
* All groups are either placed randomly in the selected area or focus on pre-placed "points of interest"

**SETUP & DOCUMENTANTION**

TBA
