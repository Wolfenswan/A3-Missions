Wolfenswan [FA]: wolfenswanarps@gmail.com | folkarps.com

**INTRODUCTION**

My goal is to create a simple spawn system, aimed at two types of mission makers:

* Beginner mission makers who are not yet comfortable with SQF and prefer to mostly use the in-game editor.
* Intermediate to advanced mission makers who want to churn out small to medium sized missions on a regular basis and need a simple spawn system as foundation for their missions, allowing them to focus on building a mission around the set-pieces.



**SETUP & DOCUMENTANTION**

TBA
