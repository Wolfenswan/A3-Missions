<br/>
The boss of the Pyrgos mafia has been eluding us for too long. The plan was to strike while he's paying his respects at <marker name='mkrSting'>the Pyrgos graveyard</marker> but someone must have tipped them off. The first unit was wiped out and now you'll have to finish the job.
<br/><br/>
ENEMY FORCES
<br/>
The Altis mafia prefers pistols and small SMGs but doesn't have access to military equipment.
